It’s kind of an eco paper-rock-scissors situation.
Renewable solar energy that could power millions of homes on the one hand.
A pristine Western landscape and fragile ecosystem with rare animals and plants on the other.
And finally, a lumbering prehistoric desert-dweller with an austere lifestyle and strong family values.
The plight of the desert tortoises has come to symbolize the cause of grass-roots groups like Western Watersheds and Defenders of Wildlife that are fighting to stop the construction of a 370-megawatt solar plant on 3,600 acres (1,459 ha) of public land in the Mojave called the Ivanpah Valley. The ongoing protest has managed to scare off several energy companies and to win some major concessions from the one company that has managed to hang in. But the fight is far from over.
