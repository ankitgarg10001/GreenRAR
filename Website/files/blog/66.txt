Greenhouse gases, while natural to this planet currently hold concentration levels that are far higher than natural. Plastics are already purely man-made to begin with, but its potential threat is made worse by having having too much of the material to dump as trash.
But what if we could combine these two within a cycle so that they would actually be beneficial instead of harmful to the environment? The idea may sound a little too good to be true, but that is exactly what this new company plans to do.
Newlight Technologies, LLC, is a company that was built under the foundation of a specific research in greenhouse gases and plastics. The basic principle of the company s idea lies from the common link of the two, which are carbon compounds. Plastics, for example are usually derived from petrochemicals or oil, substances which contain hydrocarbons. Most fossil fuels today also hold a form of hydrocarbon, and it is an important source of energy for millions of vehicles and other heavy machinery worldwide.
The company currently has a working process of reversing the fuel combustion process in order to link it to the process of making plastic. In other words, they use carbon emissions as their primary ingredient along with hydrocarbons to make their special Airflex thermoplastic.
The steps in making their plastic are rather simple. They first need to collect the extracted carbon emissions into a reactor. The next step is to separate oxygen from carbon dioxide, where the remaining carbon molecules are reassembled into a long-chain thermopolymer. Additional options to further enhance the basic attributes or qualities of the resulting plastic material can be done afterwards. For example, it can be processed to have the same properties as some plastics that are used for specific purposes (e.g. polystyrene, polypropylene, etc.).
Aside from helping reduce carbon emissions by actually using it as a central ingredient, the fact that the resulting material is a thermoplastic means that it can also be easily recyclable. Unlike some plastics that degrade when heated, it could simply be melted, reprocessed and remolded again for constant reuse. With a good waste plastic recycling program or salvaging system, this could mean a complete internal loop, fully separating the plastic from its natural surroundings (where it could cause harm).</p>
