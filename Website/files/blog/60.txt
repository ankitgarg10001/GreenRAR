<p>During my past work place at leading Investment banks in NYC, I never got an opportunity to work from home. I have come across many of my friends who would work from home. As a mother of infant baby, I had gone through huge issues.then started thinking what would happen if I worked from home. In the process of little research & analysis, what I discovered is its is totally win-win situation for Corporates and Employees. How, check it our?
What corporate can gain?
- Office space: think of office prices in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Banglore etc. What is the cost of office building for 1000 seating? I was looking for 1000 sqft decent office in Andheri(E), it was astonishingly high at 80l-1 cr. Office space in midtown NYC can be anywhere between 5000-1000 USD for 1000 sqft.
- Electricity: saving of electricity. Employers can vouch you the cost of electricity due light and air conditioning.
- Parking lot: we are not there yet when every employee would prefer to drive to office. In USA, most of the employers provide parking space if the offices are NOT located in major cities.
- Subsidized food: many companies with large number of employees do provide these facilities. With food prices rising around the world, the canteen bill will definitely going to affect drastically.
- Monitoring cost of employees  be it surveillance camera or attending machines- Additional cost of HR   for general HR issues including dispute resolutions
What corporate can loose??
- Face to face interaction for understanding the work.
- the employees who are not motivated needs constant surveillance which would be difficult to monitor if 

he/she works from home
- affect on performance
What Employee can gain?
- The extra time with family members; the time you spend away from home and the time of travel.
- The cost nanny: its really breaks one s budget if its single parent or single earning and needing the nanny 

services. I pay about USD 1600 for nanny services. Although, I have spent additional money for 

surveillance camera and required infrastructure for the cam, I haven t got feeling for comfort for a single 

day.
- Cost of Gas: yes, its tremendous. I am paying on and average USD 1000 for my gas. It makes huge 

difference in my monthly budget if I can avoid traveling to client site or work from home.
- Cost Toll: In India, toll is just beginning, it will get to the point, where the commuters fill feel the pinch.
- Cost of formal dresses: it is unbelievably high one keeps a track of total money spend on formal dressing 

to the office. (pls remember tech-mahindra s dress coding article.) you can not go to office in flip-flops or 

denim.
What employees can loose??:
- Not sure if the spouse (especially stay in moms) would appreciate your constant interfering in her 

household work.
- May be kids do not want to be monitored so closely.
- Personal growth   by working closely an employee knowingly or unknowing learns about 

work/knowledge/behavior. Its kind of industry updates/happenings.
Some of the solutions to these problems could be  
- Initially, I thought that work from home for partial day. (It would disadvantage to the employees as they 

have to spend same amount of money and time for travel, clothes, nanny .)
- Working from home for part of the week i.e. 2-3 days a week. This would allow one team to occupy 

the space on certain days. The corporate can accommodate two teams for the cost of one. In this 

situation, the whole team can manage their meetings, presentations, and performance review etc as per 

their schedule. Its still 50% cost saving for both corporate and employees. Win-win situation.
-Corporates can gain carbon credit by letting employee work from home, thus resulting in saving fuel / 

natural resources & helping government to reduce traffic, vehicular pollution & most important the foreign 

exchange that require to buy the oil.
-Employees too can feel better by being more environmental friendly by saving natural resources, reducing 

vehicular pollution, making personal contribution towards government treasury & of, course saving money.
So work from home, by all means, is going GREEN
